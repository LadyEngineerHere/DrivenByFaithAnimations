# Driven By Faith Animations

Welcome to the **Driven By Faith Animations** project! This repository houses a collection of animations that celebrate the intersection of Muslim culture and the automotive industry, all with a touch of faith-inspired creativity.

## About
**Driven By Faith Animations** is dedicated to highlighting the inspiring stories of Muslim women in the automotive industry. The project was born from a deep commitment to create a meaningful platform where faith, culture, and industry converge through captivating animations.

## Project Journey
The journey of **Driven By Faith Animations** began with a simple idea â€” to craft animations that not only celebrate the achievements of Muslim women in the automotive industry but also weave in the values and principles that define their faith. With this vision in mind, we set out to create a visual narrative that speaks volumes.

Starting from scratch, we utilized the power of ADOBE Firefly AI, Figma, and Sigma to curate meaningful imagery that resonates with the project's essence. This process was exhilarating and enlightening, allowing us to infuse every animation with layers of cultural depth and automotive spirit.

Once the images were ready, the venture into the world of HTML and CSS began. Armed with newfound skills and determination, a captivating first page was designed to serve as the gateway to the animations. The mock-up stands as a testament to the dedication, navigating the intricacies of CSS text animation, sliding elements, and interactive hover-zoom effects. This journey was undoubtedly a learning curve, marking our first foray into using animations for front-end web design.
